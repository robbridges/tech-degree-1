/*
All this method is doing is returning a random index from the array, so that we can later access it's object properties in the printQuote method. 
Math.floor rounds the number down, since javascript .random is weird and doesn't guarantee to return us a whole value, we had to turn something like .86 * 5 down to 4,
as trying to pass quotes[4.3] would just break the program.
We multiply it by quotes length so that the math.floor can round down to multiple indexes, including something like .06 * 5 that would correct be rounded down to 0, to capute the 
first index value, but also a high random like .99 * 5 will still be 4, since math.random will never be 1 we should never see this method try to pull a quote out of the array index.
This method is also built to scale, so that it grows with the quotes array size.
